# Deep learning for solar radiation forecasting
Highly accurate forecasting solar-radiation models based on deep learning are crucial for optimal management of solar energy systems. This project presents a methodology based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast solar irradiance at different time scales.
